/**
 * General purpose settings loading class.
 *
 * The class first reads a specified file extracting a map object with
 * settings. It then attempts to read a second file which, if successfull,
 * will be merged to override values from the first.
 *
 * The module exported in each file must either be a map, in which case
 * it is used directly, or a function with no arguments. In the latter case
 * it will be called in order to obtain the map.
 *
 * The intended use is that the first file contains project level settings
 * that are checked into a repository. The second file should be for local
 * (development) overrides and should not be checked in.
 *
 * If the primary file is allowed optional and is not found, we still
 * attempt to read the secondary, but it is never an error if that file
 * does not exist.
 *
 * Both primary and secondary files may contain a property called webpack_mode
 * that, in turn, may contain properties named "development" and
 * "production". During loading, if these properties are present, the whole
 * "webpack_mode" property is *NOT* delivered in the final result, but the
 * sub-property corresponding to webpack's "--mode" argument is merged
 * with the configuration object at the top-level. This allows either
 * sub-property to override defaults in the settings.
 *
 * Provide some convenience member variables in the Settings object:
 * settings_config {object} object with the arguments to the constructor
 * settings {object} The values map of the settings that were configured
 *
 * In many cases a user of this class will only be intersted in the values
 * component. A typical usage patterns would the be:
 * <pre><code>
 * const Settings = require('Settings');
 * const settings = (new Settings()).values;
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * This does make the "config" component of the Settings instance unavailable.
 * That can be remedied:
 * <pre><code>
 * const Settings = require('Settings');
 * const _settings = new Settings();
 * const settings = _settings.values;
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * Now the config is available as "_settings.config".
 *
 * @type {NVRSettings}

class Settings {
  /**
   * Construct the settings object by attempting to read and merge
   * both files.
   *
   * Settings file and alternate or specified as filenames only. They
   * are always looked for in the project root directory.
   *
   * "env", and "args" options are intended to be passed in like so:
   * <pre><code>
   * const Settings = require('./Settings');
   *
   * module.exports = (env, args) => {
   *   const settingsObject = new Settings({ env: env, args: args });
   *   const settings = settingsObject.settings;
   *
   *   return {
   *   ... webpack config here, using things like
   *   ... settings.app_title
   *   };
   * }
   * </code></pre>
   *
   * The Settings object inspects "args.mode" to determine how to overload
   * some settings values, and defaults to 'none' if not present.
   * Alternatively, null can be passed for "env", and you could pass
   * <pre>{ mode: 'development' }</pre> for args (or use 'production').
   * Both values will be available later from  settingsObject.settings_config
   * and using the values from webpack gives full access to everything webpack
   * knows.
