read_lines <<-'INSTRUCTIONS'
Unless there are errors above, everything you need should have been installed
and you are now ready to build, install, and then use moonfire.

Build by executing the script: scripts/build.sh
Install by executing the script: scripts/install.sh (run automatically by build
step).
